How to Fix "Buffering timed out after 10000ms" Error in Mongoose ?
Ans-According to Documentation found in this link: https://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html#buffering

Mongoose lets you start using your models immediately, without waiting for mongoose to establish a 
connection to MongoDB.

That's because mongoose buffers model function calls internally. This buffering is convenient, but also
a common source of confusion. Mongoose will not throw any errors by default if you use a model without 
connecting.

TL;DR:

Your model is being called before the connection is established. You need to use async/await with 
connect() or createConnection(); or use .then(), as these functions return promises now from Mongoose 5.
